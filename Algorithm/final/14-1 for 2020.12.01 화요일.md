- Kruskal’s algorithm

  - In each step, find and add an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the (current) forest.

- Prim’s algorithm

  - In each step, find and add an edge of the least possible weight that connects the (current) tree to a non-tree vertex.

#### Generic MST Algorithm and its Correctness

- Generic algorithm for a graph G = (V, E) with a weight function w
  - For an edge set A that is a subset of some MST, an edge (u, v) is called a safe edge for A if A  {(u, v)} is also a subset of some MST.
  - Loop invariant for a set of edges A
     • Prior to each iteration, A is a subset of some minimum spanning tree.

```c++
Generic-MST(G) {
    A := empty; 
    // A: a set of edges of G 
    While (A does not form a spanning tree) {
        Find and edge (u, v) that is safe for A;
        A := A  {(u, v)}; 
    }
}
```

- Some definitions

  > Courtesy of T. Cormen et al.

  -  A cut (S, V-S) of G is a partition of V.
  - An edge (u, v) of G crosses a cut (S, V-S) if u  S and v  V-S→cut-set.
  - A cut respects a set A of edges if no edge in A crosses the cut.
  - An edge is a light edge crossing a cut if its weight is the minimum of any edge crossing the cut.

#### Cut Property

- For any cut C of the graph, if the weight of an edge e in the cut-set of C is strictly smaller than the weights of all other edges of the cut-set of C, then this edge belongs to all MSTs of the graph.

- Proof: 
  - Assume that there is an MST $$T$$ that does not contain e. 
  - Adding $$e$$ to $$T$$ will produce a cycle, that crosses the cut once at e and crosses back at another edge $$e' $$. 
  - Deleting e' we get a spanning tree $$T∖{e'}∪{e}$$ of strictly smaller weight than $$T$$. This contradicts the assumption that T was a MST.
- By a similar argument, if more than one edge is of minimum weight across a cut, then each such edge is contained in some minimum spanning tree.

```c++
Generic-MST(G) {
	A := empty; 
	// A: a set of edges of G 
  While (A does not form a spanning tree) {
    Find and edge (u, v) that is safe for A;
    A := A ∪  { (u, v) }; 
  }
}
```

- Loop invariant for the set A
  - Prior to each iteration, A is a subset of some minimum spanning tree.

- Theorem
  - Let G = (V, E) be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w defined on E. Let A be a set of E that is included in some minimum spanning tree for G, let (S, V-S) be any cut of G that respects A, and let (u, v) be a light edge crossing (S, V-S). Then, edge (u, v) is safe for A.

#### Selection of Next Edge: Kruskal’s Algorithm

- In each step, find and add an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the (current) forest.

```c++
Generic-MST(G) {
  A := empty; 
  // A: a set of edges of G 
  While (A does not form a spanning tree) {
    Find and edge (u, v) that is safe for A;
    A := A ∪ { (u, v) }; 
  }
}
```

- Theorem
  - Let G = (V, E) be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w defined on E. Let A be a set of E that is included in some minimum spanning tree for G, let (S, V-S) be any cut of G that respects A, and let (u, v) be a light edge crossing (S, V-S). Then, edge (u, v) is safe for A.

#### Selection of Next Edge: Prim’s Algorithm

- In each step, find and add an edge of the least possible weight that connects the (current) tree to a non-tree vertex.

```c++
Generic-MST(G) {
  A := empty; // A: a set of edges of G 
  While (A does not form a spanning tree) {
    Find and edge (u, v) that is safe for A;
    A := A ∪ { (u, v) }; }
}
```

- Theorem
  - Let G = (V, E) be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w defined on E. Let A be a set of E that is included in some minimum spanning tree for G, let (S, V-S) be any cut of G that respects A, and let (u, v) be a light edge crossing (S, V-S). Then, edge (u, v) is safe for A.

#### Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm 

- Idea
  - Finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest.

- Implementation using disjoint-set data structure
  - 매 단계 forest를 어떻게 관리할 것인가?
  - 두 tree를 어떻게 병합할 것인가?
  - 매 단계 (u, v)를 어떻게 선택할 것인가?

- Complexity
  - Sort the edges by weight: $$O(E log E)$$
  - Process the edges until a tree is built: $$O(E log V)$$
  - $$O(E log E + E log V) = O(E log V)$$
    - why?

#### Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm 

- Idea

  - In each step, find and add an edge of the least possible weight that connects the (current) tree to a non-tree vertex.

- Algorithm

  ```c++
  Given G = (V, E),
  Begin with a tree T0 = (V0, E0) where V0 = {v1} and E0 = {}. 
  repeat { 
    // Ti = (Vi, Ei)→Ti+1 = (Vi +1, Ei +1)
    Select a vertex v in V - Vi that is nearest to Vi. 
      // Let v is from the edge (u, v), where u in Vi.
      Update T in such a way that
      	Vi +1 = Vi + {v}, and Ei +1 = Ei + {(u, v)}.
  until (an MST is found)
  
  ```

- A key issue in implementation

  - Tree vertices와 non-tree vertices들을 어떻게 관리할 것인가?
  - Tree vertices와 non-tree vertices들 간의 최소 비용 edge를 어떻게 (효율적으 로) 찾을 것인가?
