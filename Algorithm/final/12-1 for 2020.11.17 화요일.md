### [주제 5] Greedy Methods

#### Scheduling with Deadlines

- Problem
  - Let *J* = {1, 2, ..., *n*} be a set of jobs to be served. 
  - Each job takes one unit of time to finish.
  - Each job has a deadline and a profit.
    - If the job starts before or at its deadline, the profit is obtained.
  - Schedule the jobs so as to maximize the total profit (not all jobs have to be scheduled).

- Example:

| Schedule | Total Profit |
| -------- | ------------ |
| [1, 3]   | 30 + 25 = 55 |
| [2, 1]   | 35 + 30 = 65 |
| [2, 3]   | 35 + 25 = 60 |
| [3, 1]   | 25 + 30 = 55 |
| [4, 1]   | ☞ 40+30=70   |
| [4, 3]   | 40 + 25 = 65 |

| Job  | Deadline | Profit |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| 1    | 2        | 30     |
| 2    | 1        | 35     |
| 3    | 2        | 25     |
| 4    | 1        | 40     |

- A greedy approach
  - Sort the jobs in non-increasing order by profit.
  - Scan each job in the sorted list, adding it to the schedule if possible.

- Example

  S = EMPTY

  Is S = {1} OK? • Yes: Sß{1} ([1])

  Is S = {1, 2} OK? • Yes: Sß{1, 2} ([2, 1])

  Is S = {1, 2, 3} OK? • No.

  Is S = {1, 2, 4} OK?

  Yes: Sß{1, 2, 4} ([2, 1, 4] or [2, 4, 1])

  Is S = {1, 2, 4, 5} OK? • No.

  Is S = {1, 2, 4, 6} OK? • No.

  Is S = {1, 2, 4, 7} OK? • No.

   

  <After sorting by profit>

| Job  | Deadline | Profit |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| 1    | 3        | 40     |
| 2    | 1        | 35     |
| 3    | 1        | 30     |
| 4    | 3        | 25     |
| 5    | 1        | 20     |
| 6    | 3        | 15     |
| 7    | 2        | 10     |



| Job   | Deadline | Profit |
| ----- | -------- | ------ |
| **1** | **1**    | 100    |
| **2** | **6**    | 80     |
| **3** | **3**    | 90     |
| **4** | **3**    | 120    |
| **5** | **5**    | 40     |
| **6** | **4**    | 105    |
| **7** | **1**    | 115    |
| **8** | **2**    | 85     |
| **9** | **4**    | 50     |

#### Implementation Issues

- A key operation in the greedy approach

  - Determine if a set of jobs *S* is feasible.
  - Fact
    - *S* is feasible if and only if the sequence obtained by ordering the jobs in *S* according to nondecreasing deadlines is feasible.

  - Example
    - Is *S* = {1, 2, 4} OK?→[2(1), 1(3), 4(3)]→Yes!
    - Is *S* = {1, 2, 4, 7} OK?→[2(1), 7(2), 1(3), 4(3)]→No

- An **O****(****n****2****)** implementation

  - Sort the jobs in non-increasing order by profit. 
  - For each job in the sorted order,
    - See if the current job can be scheduled together with the previously selected jobs, using a linked list data structure.
      - If yes, add it to the list of feasible sequence.
      - Otherwise, reject it.

  - Time complexity
    - When there are *i*-1 jobs in the sequence,
      - at most *i*-1 comparisons are needed to add a new job in the sequence, and
      - at most *i* comparisons are needed to check if the new sequence is feasible.

- Is the time complexity always **O****(n2)**? **
  - **What if **n** **>>** **d****max**?**
    - **• *O*(*n*log*n*+*nd**max*)
  - What if **n** **>>** **d****max** and **n** **>>** **k****scanned**?**
    - **• *O*(*n* + *k**scanned* log *n* + *k**scanned* *d**max*) = *O*(*n*)  
    - Is this complexity achievable when a max heap data structure is employed?

| Job   | Deadline | Profit |
| ----- | -------- | ------ |
| **1** | **1**    | 100    |
| **2** | **6**    | 80     |
| **3** | **3**    | 90     |
| **4** | **3**    | 120    |
| **5** | **5**    | 40     |
| **6** | **4**    | 105    |
| **7** | **1**    | 115    |
| **8** | **2**    | 85     |
| **9** | **4**    | 50     |

#### Data Structures for Disjoint Sets 

- [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)
- Partition
  - A partition of a set X is a set of non-empty subsets of X such that every element x in X is in exactly one of these subsets.
  - Example: X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}→{ {1, 3, 5}, {2}, {4, 6} }

- Disjoint-set data structure (union-find data structure)
  - Used to effectively manage a collection of subsets that partition a given set of elements.
-  Basic operations on disjoint sets
  - Makeset(x)
    - Make a set containing only the given element x.
  -  S = Find(x)
    - Determine which set the particular element x is in.
      - Typically return an element that serves as the subset’s representative.
      - May be used to determine if two elements are in the same subset.
  -  Union(x, y) (or Merge(*x*, *y*))
    - Merge two subsets into a single subset.

- Applications 
  - Tracking the connected components of an undirected graph
    - Decide if two vertices belong to the same component, or if adding an edge between them would result in a cycle.
    - Useful for implementing the Kruskal’s algorithm for finding minimum spanning tree

- Scheduling with deadlines 
- Computing shorelines of a terrain
- Classifying a set of atoms into molecules or fragments. 
- Connected component labeling in image analysis

-  Example
   $$U=\{a,b,c,d,e\}$$

  -  For (each *x* in U) 
    - Makeset(*x*); → {*a*}, {*b*}, {*c*}, {*d*}, {*e*} 
    - Union(*a*, *c*); → {*a*, *c*}, {*b*}, {*d*}, {*e*}
    - {a, c} = Find(a);
    - Union(*c*, *e*); → {*a*, *c*, *e*}, {*b*}, {*d*} 

- Implementation of disjoint sets using reversed trees 

  - Makeset(x)

    ```c++
    Makeset(x){
    	parent(x) := x
    	rank(x) := 0
    }
    ```

    - **Time complexity:** *O*(1)

- Two ways of implementing the Union Operation
  - **Time complexity:** *O*(*n*) 1
  - **Time complexity:** *O*(log *n*)

- **Union by rank**
  - Always attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree.
  - The **rank** increases by one only if two trees of the same rank are merged.
    - The rank of a one-element tree is zero.
  - The Union and Find operations can be done in O(log n) in the worst case.
    - The number of elements in a tree of rank r is at least 2 . (Proof by induction)
    - The maximum possible rank of a tree with n elements is O(log n).

- S = Find(x)

  - Time complexity: O(depth of x in the tree)

    ```c++
    Find(x) {
    if (x == parent(x))
    return x else
    return Find(parent(x)) }
    Find(x) {
    while (x != parent(x))
        x := parent(x)
      return x
    }
    ```

- Union(x, y)

  - **Time complexity:** 2 Find op’s *+ O* (1)

    ```c++
    Union(x, y) { x0 := Find(x) y0 := Find(y) if (x0 == y0)
    return
    if (rank(x0) > rank(y0))
      parent(y0) := x0
      else
    parent(x0) := y0
    if (rank(x0) == rank(y0))
    }
    rank(y0) := rank(y0)+1
    ```
