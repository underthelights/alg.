### [주제 4] Dynamic Programming

#### Minimal Triangulation

- **[A. Aho, J. Hopcroft, and J. Ullman,** **Data Structures and Algorithms****, Addison-Wesley, 1983. 10.2]**
- Problem
  - Given a set of n vertices for convex polygon, find a triangulation such that no two chords cross each other, and the total length of the chords selected is a minimum.

- Counting all possible selections of chords in an inefficient way results in an exponential algorithm.

#### The 0-1 Knapsack Problem 

- Problem
- Example
- An intuitive interpretation
  - There are n items in a store.
  - The i th item weighs wi kilograms and is worth pi wons, where wi and pi are positive integers.
  - A thief has a knapsack that can carry at most W kilograms, where W is a positive integer.
  - What items should the thief take to maximize his “profit”?

#### A 0-1 Knapsack Problem in Real Life

- [ref](http://standardwisdom.com/softwarejournal/2010/03/bang-for-the-buck-knapsacks-in-real-life/)
- Problem
  - You have a marketing budget of 5 million dollars.
  - You have the following marketing options and their paybacks in new potential customers:

| Option                               | Cost (dollars) | Expected reach (people) |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Super bowl                           | 3M             | 80M                     |
| Radio ad campaign for 40 metro areas | 800K           | 20M                     |
| TV non peak hour campaign            | 500K           | 22M                     |
| City top paper network               | 2M             | 75M                     |
| Viral marketing campaign             | 50K            | 4M                      |
| Web advertising                      | 600K           | 10M                     |

- Which marketing campaigns would you choose to maximize the total expected reach under the condition that, for each of these marketing campaigns, you either select it or you don’t?

#### How to Solve the 0-1 Knapsack Problem

- Naïve approach
  - There are 2n subsets of {1, 2, ..., n}! 
- Dynamic programming approach
  -  Let $$P(i,w)$$ be the maximized profit obtained when choosing items only from the first **i** items under the restriction that the total weight cannot exceed **w**.
  - If we let A* be an optimal subset of {1, 2, ..., n},
  - Optimal substructure

- Example

w

|      | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    |

| 2    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 2    | 3    | 3    | 3    |
| 3    | 0    | 0    | 4    | 4    | 4    | 6    | 7    |
| 4    | 0    | 0    | 4    | 4    | 4    | 8    | 8    |



#### How to Reconstruct the Solution

| 4    | 0    | 0    | 4    | 4    | 4    | 8    | 8    |

#### Implementation and Time Complexity

```c++
int zero_one_knapsack(int *p, int *w, int n, int W)
{
    int i, ww, tmp;
    for (ww = 0; ww <= W; ww++) P[0][ww] = 0;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        P[i][0] = 0;
        for (ww = 1; ww <= W; ww++)
        {
            if (w[i] <= ww)
            {
                if ((tmp = p[i] + P[i - 1][ww - w[i]]) > P[i - 1][ww])
                    P[i][ww] = tmp;
                else
                    P[i][ww] = P[i - 1][ww];
            }
            else P[i][ww] = P[i - 1][ww];
        }
    }
    return P[n][W];
}
```

$$O(nW)$$ Time

Selected items: i = 2, 3, 4, 6 Obtained profit: 19

- Is the time-complexity $$O(nW)$$ an efficient one? 
  - This is not a linear-time algorithm!
    - A problem is that W is not bounded with respect to n.
    - What if n = 20 and W = 20!?→O(n*n!)
    - When W is extremely large in comparison with n, this algorithm is worse than the brute-force algorithm that simply considers all subsets.
  - This algorithm can be improved so that the worst-case number of entries computed is O(2n).
  - No one has ever found an algorithm for the 0-1 Knapsack problem whose worst-case time complexity is better than exponential, yet no one has proven that such an algorithm is not possible!
