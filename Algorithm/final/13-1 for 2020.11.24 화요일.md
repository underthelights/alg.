##### Depth-First Search: Review 

- A graph structure definition

```c++
typedef struct _edgenode
{
    int y;               /* adjancency info */
    int weight;          /* edge weight, if any */
    struct _edgenode *next; /* next edge in list */
} edgenode;

typedef struct _graph{
    // The vertices are numbered starting from 1 not 0. edgenode *edges[MAXV + 1];
  /* adjacency info */
    int degree[MAXV + 1]; 
  /* outdegree of each vertex */
    int nvertices;        
  /* number of vertices in the graph */
    int nedges;           
  /* number of edges in the graph */
    int directed;         
  /* is the graph directed? */
} graph;
```

- A Recursive implementation in C

```c++
void dfs(graph *g, int v)
{
    edgenode *p; /* temporary pointer */
    int y;       /* successor vertex */
    entry_time[v] = ++time;
    PROCESS_VERTEX_EARLY(v);
    discovered[v] = TRUE;
    p = g->edges[v];
    while (p != NULL)
    {
        y = p->y;
        if (discovered[y] == FALSE)
        {
            parent[y] = v;
            PROCESS_EDGE(v, y, g);
            dfs(g, y);
        }
        else
            PROCESS_EDGE(v, y, g);
        p = p->next;
    }
    exit_time[v] = ++time;
    PROCESS_VERTEX_LATE(v);
    processed[v] = TRUE;
}
```

- parent = predecessor
- entry time = discovery time 
- exit time = finish time

##### An Abstract Implementation Using a Stack

- 편의상 connected graph로 가정 (아닐 경우에는?)
- 어떤 연산이 전체 탐색을 dominate하는가?
- 각 꼭지점은 unvisited 상태에서 스택에 몇 번 push되는가? 
- 전체적으로 각 edge는 몇 번 access되는가?

```c++
DFS(G, s)
{ // s is the vertex where the DFS starts. Initialize a stack S to be empty;
visited[v] = F for all vertices in G;
Push(S, s);
while (S is not empty)  
  do{  
      v = Pop(S);
      if (visited[v] = F){
        visited[v] = T;
        for (each vertex u that is adjacent to v)
          if (visited[u] = F)
            Push(S, u);
        }
    }
}
```

- Time complexity
  - Adjacency list: $$O(|V|+|E|)$$ 
  - Adjacency matrix: $$O(|V|2)$$
- 기존에 배운 recursion 기반 구현과 비교할 것

#### Graph Search 2: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- 자료구조 과목에서 배웠음

##### An Abstract Implementation Using a Queue

- 편의상 connected graph로 가정 (아닐 경우에는?)
- 어떤 연산이 전체 탐색을 dominate하는가?
- 각 꼭지점은 unvisited 상태에서 스택에 몇 번 push되는가? 
- 전체적으로 각 edge는 몇 번 access되는가?

```c++
void BFS(G, s)
{ // s is the vertex where the DFS starts. Initialize a queue Q to be empty;
visited[v] = F for all vertices in G;
visited[s] = T;
Insert(Q, s);
while (Q is not empty){
    v = delete (Q);
    for (each vertex u that is adjacent to v)    {
        if (visited[u] = F){
            visited[u] = T;
            Insert(Q, u);
        }
    }
}
```

- Time complexity
- Adjacency list: $$O(|V|+|E|) $$
- Adjacency matrix: $$O(|V|^2)$$

#### Floyd-Warshall All-Pairs Shortest Path Algorithm 

- Problem

  - Given a weighted graph *G* = (*V*, *E*) with cost function *cost*[*i*][*j*], find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. (*V* = {*v*0*, v*1*, v*2*, ..., v**n*-1} with |*V*| = *n*)
  - In general, the cost(weight) may be negative, but there must not exist a negative cycle in the graph.

- A dynamic programming approach

  - Let $$A^k [i][j]$$ be the cost of the shortest path from *i* to *j*, using only those intermediate vertices with an index ≤ *k*.

  - The goal is to compute $$A^{n-1} [i][j]$$ $$ \forall i,j = 0,1,2,...,n-1$$

  - Optimal substructure for computing $$A^k [i][j]$$ from $$A^{k-1} [i][j]$$

    1. If the shortest path from *i* to *j* going through no vertex with index greater than *k* does not go through the vertex with index *k* 

       $$A^k [i][j]$$ = $$A^{k-1} [i][j]$$

    2. If the shortest path from *i* to *j* going through no vertex with index greater than *k* does go through the vertex with index *k* 

       $$A^k [i][j]$$ = $$A^{k-1} [i][k] + A^{k-1} [k][j] $$

- The table computation
  - Initialization / Table traversal order 
  - Example: *k* = 4 (*A**k*[*i*][*j*]*A**k*-1[*i*][*j*])
  - $$O(n^3)$$time
  - An in-place implementation is possible.

#### Minimum Spanning Trees

- Tree
  - A tree is a connected graph T that contains no cycle. 
  - Other equivalent statements (T = (V, E) where |V| = n)
  - T contains no cycles, and has n-1 edges.
  - T is connected, and has n-1 edges.
  - Any two vertices of T are connected by exactly one path.
  - T contains no cycles, but the addition of any new edge creates exactly one cycle.

- Forest
  - A forest is a graph with no cycles.
