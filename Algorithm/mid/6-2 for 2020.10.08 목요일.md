#### Selection of the k-th Smallest Element

- [A. Aho, J. Hopcroft, and J. Ullman, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Addison-Wesley, 1974. 3.6] 

- Problem

  - Given a sequence of $$S$$ of $$n$$ elements and an integer $$k (1 <= k <= n)$$, find the $$k^{th}$$ smallest element of $$S$$.

- **Solution 1:** 

  - Choose the smallest element repeatedly k times.

    $$C = c(n-1)+c(n-2)+c(n-3)+...+c(n-k) = c \cdot k \cdot n - c \cdot \frac {k(k+1)} 2$$

    if $$ k= \frac n 2 $$ then $$C = c \cdot \frac {n^2} 2 - c \cdot \frac {n^2 + 2n} 8 = O(n^2)$$

- **Solution 2:** 

  - Build a min-heap, and then extract the smallest element repeatedly $$k$$ times.

    $$C = c \cdot n + d \cdot k \cdot log n$$

    if $$ k= \frac n 2 $$ then $$C = c \cdot n + d \cdot \frac n 2 \cdot log n = O(n log n)$$

- **Can we design an $$O(n)$$-time algorithm?**

#### Observation

- At least $$O(n)$$ time is necessary.
- If we use a divide-and-conquer scheme like the merge sort, What about $$T(n) = 3T(n/3) + cn$$?
- Can we design an O(n)-time algorithm for this selection problem? – What about $$T(n) = T(an) + T(bn) + cn$$ with $$a + b < 1$$?

#### Algorithm

- Step 1: Divide S into floor(|S|/5) sequence of 5 elements each with up to four leftover elements.
- Step 2: Sort each 5-element sequence.
- Step 3: Let M be the sequence of medians of the 5-element sets. Then, let m be the median of the elements in M.
- Step 4: Let S1, S2, and S3 be the sequences of elements in S less than, equal to, and greater than m, respectively.
  - If $$|S1| >= k$$, then find the k-th smallest element of S1.
  - else if $$(|S1| + |S2| >= k)$$, then m is the k-th smallest element of S. 
  - else find the $$(k – |S1| - |S2|)^{th}$$ smallest element of $$S3$$.

#### A divide-and-conquer strategy

- Facts
  - At least one-fourth of the elements of S are less than or equal to m.
  - At least one-fourth of the elements of S are greater than or equal to m.
  - |S1| <= 3n/4 and |S3| <= 3n/4

> - S1: the set of all elements less than m 
> - S2: the set of all elements equal to m
> - S3: the set of all elements greater than m

#### Time Complexity

> - Input size n = |S|
> - |M| <= ceil(n/5)
> - |S1| <= 3n/4
> - |S3| <= 3n/4

#### Selection Algorithm: Complexity Analysis

#### Master Theorem 1

- Let a, b, and c be nonnegative constants. 
- The solution to the recurrence $$T (1)=1$$, and $$T(n)=aT(n/c)+bn$$, for $$n>1$$for $$n$$ a power of $$ c$$ is
  - 1. $$T(n)=O(n)$$, if $$a<c$$ 
    2. $$T(n)=O(nlogn)$$, if $$a=c$$ 
    3. $$T(n) = O(nlogca)$$, if $$a > c$$
- [Neapolitan 2.8]
- Prove this by induction!
- Avoid divided-and-conquer if, for example–
  - An instance of size n is divided into two or more instances each almost of size n.
  - An instance of size n is divided into almost n instance of size n/c, where c is a constant.

- **The divide-and-conquer strategy often leads to efficient algorithms, although not always!**
