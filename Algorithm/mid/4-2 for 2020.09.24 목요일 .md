#### Heap Sort

- $$ref.$$ [Horowitz 7.7] [Neapolitan 7.6]
- Method
  - 1 Convert an input array of n unordered items into a max heap.
  - 2 Extract the items from the heap one at a time to build an ordered array.

- 주어진 정수들을 비감소 순서(non-decreasing order)대로 정렬하라.

~~~c++
typedef struct{
 int key;
 /* other fields */

```
} element;
Element list[MAX_SIZE];
```
} element;
Element list[MAX_SIZE];
~~~

```c++
void heapsort(element list[], int n){
  /*perform heapsort on the array*/
  int i, j;
  element temp;
  // Make a (max) heap
  for(i = (n)/2; i > 0; i--) 
    adjust(list, i, n);
  // Extract items one by one
  for(i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    SWAP(list[1], list[i+1], temp);
    adjust(list, 1, i);
  }
}
```

1. O(n) 
2. O(nlog n) -> O(nlogn)

- Make a (max) heap.

#### The adjust() function

- Input
  - a binary tree T whose left and right subtrees satisfy the heap property but whose root may not

- Output
  - a binary tree T adjusted so that the entire binary tree satisfies the heap property

```c++
void adjust(element list[], int root, int n){
    int child, rootkey;
    element temp;
 
    temp = list[root];
    rootkey = list[root].key;
    child = 2*root;
    while(child <= n){
        if((child < n) && (list[child].key < list[child+1].key)) child++;
        if(rootkey >= list[child].key) break;
        else {
            list[child/2] = list[child];
            child *= 2;
        }
    }
    list[child/2] = temp;
}
```

- Executed *d* times, where *d* is the depth of the tree with root *i*
  - So $$O(d)$$ time

##### 2. Extract items one by one.

```c++
swap(list[1], list[(n-1)+1], temp);
adjust(list, 1, n-1);

swap(list[1], list[(n-2)+1], temp);
adjust(list, 1, n-2);

swap(list[1], list[(n-3)+1], temp); 
adjust(list, 1, n-3);
```



#### Complexity of Item Extractions



#### Priority Queue 2: Min-Max Heap

- Problem
  - The following operations must be performed as mixed in data processing:
    - Store a record with a key in an arbitrary order. 
    - Fetch the record with the current largest key. 
    - Fetch the record with the current smallest key.

- A solution
  - Design a data structure that offers the efficient implementation of the following operations (Double-Ended Priority Queue):
    - Insert an element with an arbitrary key. 
    - Delete an element with the largest key. 
    - Delete an element with the smallest key.

### [주제 3] Divide-and-Conquer Techniques and Sorting Techniques

#### Algorithm Design Techniques

- Divide-and-Conquer Method
- Dynamic Programming Method
- Greedy Method
- Backtracking Method
- Local Search Method
- Branch-and-Bound Method
- Etc.

#### The Divide-and-Conquer Approach

- 1. Divide an instance of a problem into one or more smaller instances.
- 2. Conquer (Solve) each of the smaller instances. Unless a smaller instance is sufficiently small, use recursion to do this.
- 3. If necessary, combine the solutions to the smaller instances to obtain the solution to the original instance.

#### Recursion

- Tower of Hanoi
  - $$T(n) = 2T(n-1) +1, n>1$$, $$T(1) = 1$$

- Recursive thinking!

#### Sorting

>  A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two items with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.

- Problem: 

  - Given a list of n items, arrange them **in a certain order.**
    - Ex: non-increasing, non-decreasing, or etc.

- Some criteria for choosing a sorting algorithm 

  - How many items will you be sorting?
  - Will there be duplicate items in the data?
  - What do you know about the data?
    - Is the data already partially sorted?
    - Do you know the distribution of the items?
    - Are the keys of items very long or hard to compare? 
    - Is the range of possible keys very small?

  - Do you have to worry about disk accesses?
  - Do you need a stable sorting algorithm?
  - How much time do you have to write and debug your routine?

#### A Formal Definition of Sorting

- A **partial order** on a set S is a relation R such that for each a, b, and c in S:
  - $$aRa$$ is true (R is reflexive).
  - $$aRb$$ and $$bRc$$ imply $$aRc$$ (R is transitive), and
  - $$aRb$$ and $$bRa$$ imply $$a = b$$ (R is antisymmetric).

- A Linear Order or Total Older on a set $$S$$ is a partial order R on S such that for every pair of elements a, b, either aRb or bRa.
- The sorting problem:
  - Given a sequence of $$n$$ elements $$a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$$ drawn from a set having a linear order $$\preceq $$
  - find a permutation $$\Pi = (\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_n)$$ of $$(1,2,...,n)$$ that will map the sequence into a nondecreasing sequence $$a_{\pi_1}, a_{\pi_2},...,a_{\pi_n}$$ such that $$a_{\pi_1} \preceq a_{\pi_i+1}$$ for $$1 \leq i < n $$
- Ex: $$ \leq$$ on $$\mathbb{Z}$$, $$\subseteq $$ on sets 
- Sorting on data with partial order?

#### Merge Sort

- **Problem**: Sort *n* keys in nondecreasing sequence.
- **Inputs**: positive integer *n,* array of keys *S* indexed from 1 to *n*.
- **Outputs**: the array *S* containing the keys in nondecreasing order.

- 1 **Divide** the array into two subarrays each with ~n/2 items.
- 2 **Conquer** each subarray by sorting it recursively.
- 3 **Combine** the solutions to the subarrays by merging them into a single sorted array.

- A simple implementation

```c++
// Sort a list from A[left] to A[right].
 // Should be optimized for higher efficiency!!!

void **merge_sort**(item_type *A, int left, int right) { int middle;
if (left < right) {
 middle = (left + right)/2;
**merge_sort**(A, left, middle); **merge_sort**(A, middle + 1, right);
**merge**(A, left, middle, right); }
}
```

| k    | left        | right       | merged                  |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| 1    | 10 12 20 27 | 13 15 22 25 | 10                      |
| 2    | 10 12 20 27 | 13 15 22 25 | 10 12                   |
| 3    | 10 12 20 27 | 13 15 22 25 | 10 12 13                |
| 4    | 10 12 20 27 | 13 15 22 25 | 10 12 13 15             |
| 5    | 10 12 20 27 | 13 15 22 25 | 10 12 13 15 20          |
| 6    | 10 12 20 27 | 13 15 22 25 | 10 12 13 15 20 22       |
| 7    | 10 12 20 27 | 13 15 22 25 | 10 12 13 15 20 22 25    |
| -    |             |             | 10 12 13 15 20 22 25 27 |



```c++
item_type *buffer; // extra space for merge sort, allocated beforehand

void merge(item_type *A, int left, int middle, int right) { 
  int i, i_left, i_right;
  memcpy(buffer + left, A + left, sizeof(item_type)*(right - left + 1));
  i_left = left;
  i_right = middle + 1;
  i = left;
  while ((i_left <= middle) && (i_right <= right)) { 
    if (buffer[i_left] < buffer[i_right])
      A[i++] = buffer[i_left++]; 
    else
      A[i++] = buffer[i_right++]; }
  while (i_left <= middle)
    A[i++] = buffer[i_left++];
  while (i_right <= right)
    A[i++] = buffer[i_right++];
}
}
```
